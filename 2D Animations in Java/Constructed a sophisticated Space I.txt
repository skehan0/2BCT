Constructed a sophisticated Space Invaders game using Java and the Swing library, demonstrating proficiency in game development and object-oriented programming. The application boasts a visually appealing 800x600 pixel game window, meticulously designed to be centered on the screen for an optimal gaming experience.

Key features include an array of alien invaders, each with distinct movement patterns, AI behavior, and collision detection algorithms. The player assumes control of a responsive spaceship, capable of precise movements using the left and right arrow keys. Firing bullets with the spacebar adds an exciting dimension to gameplay, with projectiles accurately tracked and updated.

Scoring mechanics are seamlessly integrated, rewarding the player with points for every successfully destroyed alien ship. Multiple waves of increasing difficulty challenge the player's skills, with speed-enhanced alien waves providing an extra layer of complexity.

To ensure fluid gameplay, the code employs a multithreaded architecture, guaranteeing smooth animation and real-time updates. Additionally, the application implements double-buffering techniques to eliminate screen flickering during graphics rendering.

This project serves as a testament to both Java programming prowess and the ability to develop intricate, interactive games, showcasing expertise in graphics rendering, collision detection, event handling, and overall game logic
